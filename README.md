# Discord Choosable Roles (WIP)
## Description
A small open-source Discord Bot written in Python which will allow you to react to messages and obtain roles. This will be used in a personal Discord server of mine.

## Requirements
The Discord.py [package](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) is required in order to use this bot. You may install this via the following command.

```
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```
